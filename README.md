# 4.4 - Second Collections Assignment
You will finish your second collection (Model).
You will need to:

Use select() to exclude info like version
Use populate to display your first collection (model) in your second model
In all the (id) functions check to see if the object is in the database first, if so, then display "object" not found, like in the examples. (GET by ID, etc.)
Put your hardcoded messages in a Messages module
When posting your second collection use the id from the first collection, (found in MongoDB)
Use Postman to view ALL your function payloads
